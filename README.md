**Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository:
2. git clone [url](https://github.com/bhardwaj-sunil/FetchRandomImage/)
3. Open the project in Xcode.
4. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.
5. Press the Fetch Random Image button to add a random entry to the list.
6. Manage your items by deleting or reordering them.

**Project Structure** Followed MVVM architecture design pattern

1. ViewModel: Handles data fetching, persistence, and UI updates.
2. Views: UIKit components to display the list and controls. I have used tableview controller.
3. Models: Data models representing image entries from the API.
4. Services: Networking layer to fetch API data.
5. Tests: Integration tests covering critical functionality.
